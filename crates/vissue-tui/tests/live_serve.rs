//! The shipped client against the shipped server.
//!
//! Every other test of this backend answers it from a stub that writes
//! canned JSON, which proves the client parses what the stub was told to
//! send and nothing about whether the server sends that. The unit tests on
//! the other side call the server's dispatch directly, with no client and no
//! socket. Neither half tests the pair, so a disagreement between them
//! survives a green run: a mutation the server accepted but did not make
//! visible to the next read looks identical to one it made, until someone
//! runs the two together by hand.
//!
//! This file runs them together. The server is a real owner on a real
//! socket, with its own catalog and watcher; the client is `ControlBackend`,
//! the same one `vissue tui` and `vissue hud` attach with.
